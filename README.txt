= JS On Acid

A port of Ruby On Acid to JavaScript.  A library for making trippy visuals and sounds.  Need to pick locations and colors to draw in?  Let one of JS On Acid's "factories" do it for you.  Then swap out one factory for another without changing your code.  Need to pick a note from a scale or a tempo?  JS On Acid factories can do that too.  And if none of the bundled factories does what you need, it's easy to write your own.
